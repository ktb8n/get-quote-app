# Get Quote App


### Objective
Create an app that displays a quote and the author upon clicking a button


### Goals
1. Change the background color "randomly" from an array of colors. 

2. Change the font of the author to look like various signatures.

3. Add a random background image - I tried to do this with another axios call in the same App.js file and it didn't work. I suspect I would need to import/export this feature as a separate component. More research required.
